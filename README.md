# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

In using Jupyter Notebook, Python Data, Anaconda, Matplotlib, CSV files, and Panda dataframe conversions; I was able to determine the ride sharing data within rural, suburban, and urban cities. 

## Purpose

The intent of this challenge was to draw an easy to read visulaization, depicting the ride share data. By analyzing the rides, drivers, and fares totals, as well as the urban, rural, and suburban city types, an accurate conclusion of the numer of rides each day, was achieved.

## Results

In order to illustrate a clear visualization, I firest needed to break down the:

- #### Total Rides

- #### Total Drivers

- #### Total Fares

![total_fares](/assets/total_fares.png)

- #### Average Fare Per Ride

- #### Average Fare Per Driver

- #### Total Fare by City Type

#### Overall Vizualization

## Summary

A few business recommendations I'd offer the CEO, to better the ride share outcomes, would be:
1. Because Urban city areas have the most use of ride shares, hiring more staff would produce higher monetary outputs. 
2. In the Suburban city areas, peak ride share use is late February, during this time, I suggest raising the fares. 
3. Rural city areas seem to have a relatively constant low fare value, an option is to raise the fares and allow farther distances of driving.
